# Plant Label Creator

**Plant Label Creator** is a simple yet powerful tool that generates 3D printable STL files for plant labels. Whether you're growing a garden, cultivating plants in pots, or organizing your indoor greenery, this script provides a quick and easy way to create personalized labels.

## Features
- **Two label sizes**: Choose between a small or big plant label, depending on your preference and available space.
- **Customizable**: Input two lines of text to personalize your labels with the name of the plant, care instructions, or any other detail you'd like to add.
- **3D Printable**: Generates STL files ready to be printed with your 3D printer.

## How It Works
1. **Enter Text**: Input the text you'd like to appear on the label (two lines of text).
2. **Choose Size**: Select whether you want a **small** or **big** label.
3. **Generate STL**: Click **Create**, and an STL file will be generated for you to download and print.
4. **3D Print**: The labels are designed to be printed without support structures. For optimal durability, especially when exposed to strong sunlight, it is recommended to use PETG or ABS. ABS is particularly suitable for outdoor conditions due to its enhanced UV resistance.
